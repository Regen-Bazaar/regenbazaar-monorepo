# Template for foundry environment variables.

# For local development, copy this file, rename it to .env, and fill in the values.

# We provide default values so developers can start prototyping out of the box,
# but we recommend getting your own API Keys for Production Apps.

# DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY is used while deploying contract.
# On anvil chain the value of it can be empty since we use the prefunded account
# which comes with anvil chain to deploy contract.
# NOTE: You don't need to manually change the value of DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY, it should
# be auto filled when run `yarn generate`.

# Alchemy rpc URL is used while deploying the contracts to some testnets/mainnets, checkout `foundry.toml` for it's use.
